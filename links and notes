there are more, but i usually just google for stuff when I have a specific problem


i would recommend doing some vulnhub vm's before the OSCP to get some practice
depending on how much experience you have..


you should google "oscp-like vulnhub machines" there are lists of vm's which are similar to the oscp labs
 
 
 For linux https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/ 
For Windows this: http://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html 
and this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMG8IsCohHA 
For the Linux boxes, you can find some handy pre-built privesc checking scripts

when you got the documentation / report rejected
why was that
(only asking as im doing it myself and want to avoid same problem)
 
[‎21/‎08/‎2018 11:35]  
the main reason was "not enough details on buffer overflow exploitation"
I didn't include screenshots of debugger 
I just listed the values as bulletpoints
describing issue in couple paragraphs
so include enough screenshots
 
[‎21/‎08/‎2018 11:35]  Freddie Barr-Smith:  
Okay cool will do
 
[‎21/‎08/‎2018 11:35] 
on every single issu
 
[‎21/‎08/‎2018 11:35]  Freddie Barr-Smith:  
:)

it's gonna be slightly different from reports where we avoid meaningless screenshots
in there you better do it
also
 
[‎21/‎08/‎2018 11:36]  Freddie Barr-Smith:  
haha
okay

very important thing why I also probably lost points was not including 10 point flags

basically when you get initial shell, you will get local.txt file with the hash, take a screenshot of that together with ipconfig, whoami and hostname commands
when you privesc, you will get proof.txt again with the hash, do the same screenshot it
basically very carefully read the instructions and blindly follow them
don't go in mindset "oh this makes no sense, I will do it my way..." :D
